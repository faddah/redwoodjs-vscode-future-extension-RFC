## Future Features &amp; Fixes for A New RedwoodJS Visual Studio Code Extension

### Summary

Allow the communtiy to contribute features for possible new RedwoodJS VS Code Extension, since the older one has been deprecated.

### Background

RedwoodJS formerly had an Extension for Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), formerly available in [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode). However, due to most of what was needed was already available in other VS Code Extensions (eg., ESLint, Prettier, GraphQL, Prisma, TailwindCSS for Tailwind users, etc.). However, there might be more features and functionality that a RedwoodJS VS Code Extension could offer in the Developer Experience (DX). Hence, this RFC where those in the Redwood Community could file issues as feature requests and / or workaround fixes for issues currently in RedwoodJS for a future

### Proposal

[The Redwood Community](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/welcome-to-the-redwoodjs-community/) shall work together as Developer Contributors for this new version of the RedwoodJS Visual Studio Code Extension — perhaps leveraging some of the usable framework and code from the former, now deprecated, RedwoodJS VS Code Extension (i.e., the Navigation Tree from there, etc.). Community members will take an agreed-upon feature set from this RFC, run them by the [RedwoodJS Core Team](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/README.md#core-team-lead-maintainers-and-community-leads), and then, given the go ahead by the RedwoodJS Core Team, will then code, implement, test &amp; deploy to this repository for the Redwood Core Team to review and consider releasing.

This will follow an Agile process, with new features assigned to volunteer Open Source Developers who wish to contribute to this project, and new features added as the process goes along. As the project goes along and more contributors and features are involved, we will establish remote / online times for weekly stand-ups and end-of-sprint demos of the newly added features to the extension.

### Abandoned ideas

- None yet, as no issues have yet been filed, considered and then abandoned.

### Implementation &amp; Features We Like From Issues

This is to be built by contributing members of the [RedwooodJS Community](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/welcome-to-the-redwoodjs-community/) with input via the [Commuhity Pages](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/welcome-to-the-redwoodjs-community/) and the [RedwoodJS Discord](https://discord.gg/PMACdytf) from the RedwoodJS Core Team. This section is where we will put a list of features that have been discussed under the Issues on this repository and have come to a resolution describing the feature, how to implement it, and a consensus that it is a desired feature for this RedwoodJS VS Code Extension.

To propose a feature or fix, file an **[Issue](https://github.com/faddah/redwoodjs-vscode-future-extension-RFC/issues)** in this repository. It will be discussed on the issure thread there, and if there is enough consensus that it should be a feature of the extentino, it will be added, with a link

To see how to properly write a feature request Issue for this issue, please see this Issue, **[How To FIle An Issue For This RFC](https://github.com/faddah/redwoodjs-vscode-future-extension-RFC/issues/1)**.
